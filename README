VIM SETTINGS
=================================

Saves my time when setting up a new system.  Has all my favorite VIM settings. If your
VIM isn't compiled with Ruby enabled you can still use most of the plugins except Lusty Explorer.


Requirements:
 * VIM compiled with Ruby enabled (sudo apt-get install vim-ruby)
